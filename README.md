# Car Rental Automation with ASP.NET Core API 8.0 Onion Architecture

This project is a scalable and sustainable web application developed using **ASP.NET Core 8.0**. The project is structured in line with modern software development principles. Developed with a layered architecture approach, this system is compatible with SOLID principles and has an easy-to-test structure.

## ðŸš€ Technologies and Structers Used

- **ASP.NET Core 8.0** : Modern .NET platform for developing high-performance, modular, and cloud-friendly web applications.
- **Onion Architecture** : It provides a loosely coupled and testable structure by abstracting the core of the application from the outer layers.
- **CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation)** : It provides a more scalable structure by separating data reading and writing operations.
- **MediatR (Mediator Pattern)** : A behavioral design pattern that enables loose coupling between layers and decouples responsibilities.
- **Repository Pattern** : By abstracting data access, it enables the business layer to operate independently of the data source.
- **JWT (Json Web Token)** : Secure token-based system for user authentication and authorization.
- **SignalR** : It provides dynamic user experience by providing true two-way communication (e.g. packages system, live tables, etc.).
- **Pivot Table** : Dynamic tabular structure that facilitates summarization and analysis of data.
- **FluentValidation** : It is used to define strong and readable validation rules at the object level.
- **DTO (Data Transfer Object)** : Simple and secure data models used to move data between layers.
